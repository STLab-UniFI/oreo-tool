## Quick start
In order to run the OREO tool alongside your JEE application, follow these steps:

### Getting started

1. Clone the repository 
   - `git clone https://github.com/LeonardoScommegna/oreo-tool.git`
2. Copy directories `beanTimelineManager` and the `timeLine`from `/code/src/main/java/` to the source directory of the application you want to observe with OREO. If the application is managed with maven the default path is  `/src/main/java/`. 
   - Note that the target application should be implemented with Java, in particular, OREO can observe components managed by CDI or EJB both from Java EE and Jakarta EE.
3. Add the following dependencies in the `pom.xml` of the target application:
```
<dependency>
  	<groupId>javax.enterprise</groupId>
	<artifactId>cdi-api</artifactId>
	<version>2.0.SP1</version>
	<scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
 
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.jboss.weld</groupId>
	<artifactId>weld-core-impl</artifactId>
	<version>5.0.0.Final</version>
</dependency>
```
4. Register OREO as CDI extension for your application
    - To do this, it is sufficient to copy the directory `services` from the `code/src/main/resources/META-INF/` path of this repository to the `src/main/resources/META-INF/` path of the target application.
5.Re-build the target application.

### Run OREO

1. Configure the filter. Namely [InstanceFilter.java](/code/src/main/java/beanTimelineManager/filter/InstanceFilter.java) 
    - In order to observe exclusively the instances of your interest, it is sufficient to update to the variable `PACKAGE_OF_INTEREST` inside the [InstanceFilter.java](/code/src/main/java/beanTimelineManager/filter/InstanceFilter.java) file to include the desired classes/packages.
2. Build the project and deploy on server
3. Use the application under observation normally
4. Once finished, the resulting timeline can be found in SERVER_ROOT/bin/log/

Sample Output Data
---------------
A sample of timeline output obtained using the [BooksComplete](https://github.com/Apress/Practical-JSF-Java-EE-8/tree/master/BooksComplete) open-source application is available [here](data/).
